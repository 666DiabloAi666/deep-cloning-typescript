Gauges are circular plots displaying one or more values with a dial pointing to values along the perimeter. In TypeScript the `type` option must always be set. Configuration options for the series are given in three levels: 1. Options for all series in a chart are defined in the  `plotOptions.series` object. 2. Options for all `gauge` series are defined in  `plotOptions.gauge`. 3. Options for one single series are given in  `the series instance array`. ``` Highcharts.chart('container', {   plotOptions: {     series: {       // general options for all series     },     gauge: {       // shared options for all gauge series     }   },   series: [{     // specific options for this series instance     type: 'gauge'   }] }); ```       
A variable pie series is a two dimensional series type, where each point renders an Y and Z value. Each point is drawn as a pie slice where the size (arc) of the slice relates to the Y value and the radius of pie slice relates to the Z value. In TypeScript the `type` option must always be set. Configuration options for the series are given in three levels: 1. Options for all series in a chart are defined in the  `plotOptions.series` object. 2. Options for all `variablepie` series are defined in  `plotOptions.variablepie`. 3. Options for one single series are given in  `the series instance array`. ``` Highcharts.chart('container', {   plotOptions: {     series: {       // general options for all series     },     variablepie: {       // shared options for all variablepie series     }   },   series: [{     // specific options for this series instance     type: 'variablepie'   }] }); ```
